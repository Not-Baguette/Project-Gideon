# Project-Gideon

## Description
A personal virus I made in python as a little fun project, Have a pretty nice list of features:
* `Downloader` Features:
- Updateable Payload
- Easily modifiable sleep time
- Silent and light
- No need for any paid services or complicated stuff

* `Payload` Features:
- Steals Chrome History
- Steals some specific tabs you want with *cookies included*
- Steals Chrome Password
- Steals Files with certain `keywords`, `Date modified`, and `Extension`
- Send via email

It used to have a wifi stealer but they are often detected by antiviruses
